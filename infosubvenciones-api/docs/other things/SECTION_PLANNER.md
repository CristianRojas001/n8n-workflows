> Purpose: break delivery into digestible phases so you and the assistant can tackle one slice at a time. Use this to track progress and entry/exit criteria per section.

### Section A – _Name (e.g., Foundation & Setup)_
- **Objective**: _What this section accomplishes._
- **Prerequisites**: _Docs, infra, approvals required before starting._
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] _Task description + file path hints._
  - [ ] _Task description._
  - [ ] _Add more subtasks as needed._
- **Deliverables**: _Artifacts/code expected at completion._
- **Verification**: _Commands/tests/manual checks to prove done._
- **Status**: ☐ Not started | ☐ In progress | ☐ Complete
- **Notes/Risks**: _Anything blocking or observations for future sections._

### Section B – _Name (e.g., Auth & Users)_
- **Objective**: _
- **Prerequisites**: _
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] _
- **Deliverables**: _
- **Verification**: _

- **Notes/Risks**: _

### Section C – _Name (e.g., RAG Pipeline)_ 
_(Continue pattern for additional sections: Billing, Product Surfaces, Observability, Launch, etc.)_

## Usage Tips
- At the start of each VS Code session, reference the active section and task when prompting Codex/Claude.
- Update checkboxes and status fields immediately after verifying work; assistants rely on this to avoid rework.
- Keep a short “Next actions” list at the bottom of the current section so context is always fresh.
