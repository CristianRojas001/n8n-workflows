# Project Scaffold Overview

Use this folder to spin up new AI-enabled applications with Codex/Claude inside VS Code. Each template explains what information to capture so you can “fill in the blanks” and give the assistant all required context before writing code.

## Files
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md` – delivery roadmap and milestones.
- `APP_STRUCTURE_TEMPLATE.md` – directories, services, endpoints, env vars.
- `RAG_PIPELINE_TEMPLATE.md` – ingestion, retrieval, embeddings, validation.
- `UX_SURFACES_TEMPLATE.md` – pages, states, and data needs.
- `INFRASTRUCTURE_CHECKLIST.md` – external services, credentials, scripts.
- `SECTION_PLANNER.md` – phased build guide with verification steps.
- `PROGRESS_LOG.md` – running journal of sessions, tests, blockers.
- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` – prompt-ready problem description.
- `PR_TEMPLATE.md` – review checklist for merges.
- `STORY_TEMPLATE.md` – context + acceptance criteria for larger features.

Fill these documents before asking the assistant for code so it can mirror your structure and priorities. Update them as the project evolves.
